### Crawford Group C++ Programming Tutorial in Chemistry

This Repo is my collection of compiled solutions in C++ for the Computational Chemistry series created by the Crawford Group. These solutions are primarily the solutions offered by the Crawford Group, collected and set up to be compiled and executed so that I can compare output with my other project code.

My initial pass is intended to create references that I can use for another computational chemistry project.
